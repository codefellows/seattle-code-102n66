## 1. Plan your website

1. Come up with an idea
1. Use invisionboard.com to draw it out in wireframe format
1. Tag your wireframe with proper HTML

## 2. Get ready to code your website

1. Create a repository at GitHub with the name of your website (i.e. 'cookie-stand'). Do not check the "README" box
1. Turn GitHub pages on
1. Clone the repository to your local machine under your code-101 folder (not inside your reading-notes!)
1. Change into that folder and open up VS Code
1. Turn on "live server" in VS Code so you can see your work as you code it out
1. Create an index.html file with some very basic markup and ACP to GitHub


## 3. Code it up!

1. Create all of the HTML you need to match your wireframe
1. Include meaningful text and content
1. Use placholder images to get started. Replace them with real pictures once you're done.
1. ACP when you're all done

Note, you'll need to turn in the link to your github pages website when you're all done.
